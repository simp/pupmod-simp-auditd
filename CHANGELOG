* Wed Jul 17 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.0.0-10
- Removed the sgid binary check in the audit rules because it doesn't
  actually make any sense.

* Thu Jun 27 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.0.0-9
- Added audit rules to catch the execution of sgid and suid binaries.
- Added the ability to rate limit the auditd messages. If you use this, you
  probably want to change the failure mode to 1.
- Added the ability to ignore failures in the audit configuration and continue
  and set it to true by default. Since the rules are automatically managed, the
  likelihood of one being wrong is fairly high. Also, rules will fail if a file
  doesn't exist which isn't all that helpful.

  throwing SELinux AVC's on startup.
